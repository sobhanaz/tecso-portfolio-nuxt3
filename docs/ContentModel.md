## Content Model (JSON)

Static JSON is stored under `api/` and imported in pages/components.

Common files:

- `api/blog/blog.json` – list of blog posts with `slug`, `title`, `date`, `content`, etc.
- `api/portfolio/portfolio.json` – portfolio items used by sliders and grids
- `api/services/*.json` – services list and icons
- `api/team/team.json` – team members
- `api/testimonials/testimonials.json` – testimonials

Update these to customize content without touching Vue components.
